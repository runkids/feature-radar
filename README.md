# Feature Radar

Feature Radar helps your AI coding agent discover, track, and prioritize what to build next.

Whether it's creative ideation, ecosystem scanning, user feedback, or cross-project research — it captures ideas from any source, evaluates them objectively, and maintains a living knowledge base that compounds over time.

Works with any AI agent that supports [SKILL.md](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/docs/skills.md).

## How It Works

It starts the moment you say "feature radar." Your agent analyzes your project — language, architecture, key feature areas — and builds a structured tracking system at `.feature-radar/`.

From there, every feature goes through a lifecycle: discovered as an opportunity, evaluated against real demand and strategic fit, built and archived with mandatory learning extraction. **Archiving is not the end — it's a checkpoint.** Every shipped feature produces learnings, reveals new gaps, and opens new directions. The archive checklist enforces this so institutional knowledge compounds instead of evaporating.

The skills trigger automatically — just say "what should we build next" or "this feature is done" and the right workflow kicks in.

## Installation

### With [skillshare](https://github.com/runkids/skillshare)

```bash
skillshare install runkids/feature-radar --into feature-radar
```

### With [Vercel Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)

```bash
npx skills add runkids/feature-radar
```

### Manual

Copy the skills to your agent's skill directory:

```bash
# Claude Code
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Cursor
cp -r skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/

# Windsurf
cp -r skills/* ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/

# Or any agent — just copy to its skill directory
cp -r skills/* <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

Pick individual skills if you don't need all of them:

```bash
cp -r skills/feature-radar <your-agent-skills-dir>/
cp -r skills/archive-feature <your-agent-skills-dir>/
```

## Skills Library

| Skill | Trigger | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **feature-radar** | "feature radar", "what should we build next" | Full 6-phase workflow → all directories + base.md |
| **scan-opportunities** | "scan opportunities", "brainstorm ideas" | New entries → `opportunities/` |
| **archive-feature** | "archive feature", "this feature is done" | Move to `archive/` + extraction checklist |
| **extract-learnings** | "extract learnings", "capture what we learned" | Patterns → `specs/` |
| **add-reference** | "add reference", "interesting approach" | Observations → `references/` |

### feature-radar

The full workflow. Analyzes your project, creates `.feature-radar/` with `base.md` (project dashboard), then runs 6 phases: scan, archive, organize, gap analysis, evaluate, propose. Ends by recommending what to build next.

### scan-opportunities

Discover new ideas — from creative brainstorming, user pain points, ecosystem evolution, technical possibilities, or cross-project research. Deduplicates against existing tracking and evaluates each candidate on 6 criteria including value uplift and innovation potential.

### archive-feature

Archive a shipped, rejected, or covered feature. Then runs the mandatory extraction checklist: extract learnings → specs, derive new opportunities, update references, update trends. Does NOT skip steps.

### extract-learnings

Capture reusable patterns, architectural decisions, and pitfalls from completed work. Names files by the pattern, not the feature that produced it.

### add-reference

Record external observations and inspiration — ecosystem trends, creative approaches from other projects, research findings, user feedback. Cites source URLs and dates, assesses implications, suggests new opportunities when unmet needs or innovation angles are found.

## What Gets Generated

On first run, `feature-radar` creates:

```
.feature-radar/
├── base.md           ← Project dashboard: context, feature inventory, strategic overview
├── archive/          ← Shipped, rejected, or covered features
├── opportunities/    ← Open features ranked by impact and effort
├── specs/            ← Reusable patterns and architectural decisions
└── references/       ← External inspiration, observations, and ecosystem analysis
```

**base.md** is the project dashboard — generated by analyzing your codebase, updated incrementally:

- **Project Context** — language, architecture, key feature areas, core philosophy
- **Feature Inventory** — what's built, where the code lives, docs coverage gaps
- **Tracking Summary** — counts across all categories
- **Classification Rules** — how features move between categories
- **Archive Extraction Checklist** — the mandatory checks that make knowledge compound

## Philosophy

- **Compound knowledge** — Every completed feature feeds back into the system
- **Value-driven** — Chase user value and innovation, not feature checklists
- **Honest evaluation** — Evaluate fit with YOUR architecture and users, not someone else's roadmap
- **Signal over noise** — 1 issue with no comments = weak signal; multiple independent asks = strong
- **Evidence over assumptions** — Rank by real demand and creative potential, not hypothetical value
